## Host and Container Vulnerability Management

Sysdig has an integrated solution for both (Linux) host as well as container vulnerabilities which scans for known CVEs in your pipelines, your registries as well as at runtime. And, when when we do it at runtime, the added context we bring to it really can help you to route and prioritise things!
