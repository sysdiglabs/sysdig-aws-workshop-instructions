## Pipeline Vulnerability Scanning

To scan container images for vulnerabilities before they hit a registry, much less a running environment, we have our command-line scanning tool. This can be run anywhere from a developer laptop to a pipeline. 

If a scan fails (and it is configurable by granular policies under what conditions it'll pass vs. fail) our return code will be non-zero so your pipeline can, in turn, fail that stage until it is fixed.

Here are the instructions for how to install and run our vulnerability CLI scanner: [Install Vulnerability CLI Scanner](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-secure/install-vulnerability-cli-scanner/).

We have already installed it on your jumpbox for you. You can run a scan of the image `logstash:7.16.1` which is an image that has Log4J in it by running the following command:

```bash
sudo bash; cd ~
~/sysdig-cli-scanner -a $SYSDIG_SECURE_URL logstash:7.16.1
```

Not only do you get that output into your build logs for the pipeline stage, but you can also explore the results the Sysdig SaaS UI by following that link listed in the output or going to **Vulnerabilities** -> **Pipeline** in the UI. Note that this is missing the runtime context (as, since it was scanned in a pipeline, and we don't yet know that runtime context).

## Completion

You have now completed the Pipeline Vulnerability Scanning module.
