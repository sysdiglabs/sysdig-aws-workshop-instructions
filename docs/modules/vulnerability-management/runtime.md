## Runtime Vulnerability Scanning

Go to the Sysdig browser tab and go to **Vulnerabilities** on the left and then **Runtime** under Findings.

This is a list of all of the running containers in your environment within the last 15 minutes as well as all the hosts/Nodes that our agent is installed on.

It is automatically sorted by severity for you, so the container image on top is the most important to fix, based on the quantity and severity of the In Use vulnerabilities.

![vuln1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/vuln1.png)

Click on the top container/vulnerability and then examine the top you'll see:

- The image and tag in question, we know this is running now.
- The runtime context including the deployment, namespace and cluster it is running on. This is often useful in routing the remediation work to the right team(s).

!["vuln2"]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/vuln2.png)

Click the **Vulnerabilities** tab. This is a list of all of the Vulnerabilities we found in the image.

![vuln3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/vuln3.png)

Click on one of the CVEs and note all of our details on where we learned about this vulnerability and any fixes or known exploits we know for it.

![vuln4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/vuln4.png)

Close that vulnerability detail pane.

Click on the **In Use** filter button - this excludes all the vulnerabilities that we have never seen run (and therefore are much less likely to be exploitable).

Click on the **Has fix** button - this excludes those vulnerabilities that do not yet have a new version with a fix available (and therefore your team can't patch them yet).

What we are left with is those vulnerabilities that are actually running (not just in the image) **and** for which there is a fix. This is a more reasonable and prioritized patching task to give somebody!

## Completion

You have now completed the Runtime Vulnerability Scanning module.

{: .value}
> - You have now used Sysdig Secure to find vulnerabilities **at runtime** in your environment.
> - You have seen how we can use **in-use** to find out what dependencies have been loaded into memory, and use this information to drastically reduce the number of vulnerabilities to fix.
> - You have seen how we can use **has fix** to find out which vulnerabilities have a fix available, and can use this information to prioritise the most important vulnerabilities to fix.
