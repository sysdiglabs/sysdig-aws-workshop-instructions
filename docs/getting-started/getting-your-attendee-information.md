## Get Your Attendee Information

Your instructor will provide you with access to a Google spreadsheet with some credentials to the AWS console and to access your demo Sysdig account.

![attendee-credentials]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/spreadsheet.png)

This spreadsheet will have the following information:

| Information | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Sysdig email login | Your email address for logging into Sysdig |
| Password | Your password for logging into Sysdig and AWS |
| AWS console login | Your login for accessing the AWS console |
| AWS region | The AWS region you'll be working in |
| Sysdig region | The Sysdig region you'll be working in |

## Know Your Sysdig Region

Sysdig operates several regions around the world, each independent of each other, so it's important to know which region to login to. 

{: .note }
> Most often, if you are taking the workshop in North America, you will use the US West region. If you are taking the workshop in Europe, you will use the EU region. If you are taking the workshop in Asia-Pacific, you will use the AP region.

  | EU |
  | AP |
